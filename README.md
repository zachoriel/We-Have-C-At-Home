![Last Commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/zachoriel/We-Have-C-At-Home)

This is a high-performance memory management toolkit for Unity, inspired by [git-amend's excellent primer on memory arenas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIJxPAJ3R-I). It started as an experiment to learn more about unsafe code and evolved into a full-featured arena-based allocator with custom containers, tracking, logging, and benchmark tooling ‚Äî all built to answer a single question:

> *How much performance and memory control can you reclaim from Unity's managed heap without going insane?*

And the answer is... it depends.\
But here's a hint:

## What Is a Memory Arena?

A memory arena is a low-level memory management technique where a large block of memory is allocated up front, and then smaller allocations are made from that block manually. This eliminates per-allocation overhead, enables predictable performance, and is especially useful in high-performance or real-time applications like games or simulations.

## What Is Burst?

Burst refers to the "Burst compiler" ‚Äî a Unity package that works with Unity's Job System to execute highly-optimized C# code. It adds a small amount of code complexity to your project, but yields significant speed gains in execution time. My memory arena is designed to be used alongside Burst/Jobs, but it is not a hard requirement. The benchmarks shown here include tests both with and without Burst, for empirical comparison of performance benefit.

## Why Use a Memory Arena in Unity?

Unity‚Äôs garbage collector (GC) is non-generational, incremental, and prone to stutters in GC-heavy workloads. Even Burst and Jobs don‚Äôt eliminate the problem if your allocations aren‚Äôt tightly scoped. Arena-based memory solves this by letting you allocate once, write in-place, and reset or dispose deterministically ‚Äî zero GC involved.

**But you don't have to take my word for it ‚Äî I measured it.**

## Benchmark Experiment - Design and Methodology

To test real-world impact, I implemented a sustained procedural workload that mimics conditions seen in simulation, terrain generation, and real-time systems:

> **Scenario**: Procedurally generate a 1024x1024 noise texture repeatedly, over 500 cycles, allocating a new buffer every 5 frames.

1024x1024 is a fairly extreme texture size for procedural noise, but I chose it intentionally as a tradeoff. The benchmark only generates one texture at a time, which helps isolate allocation behavior and performance impact. In real-world systems, you'd often see many smaller allocations per frame ‚Äî but the cumulative memory pressure and GC risk scale similarly. This setup simulates that load while keeping the test controlled and interpretable.

<details>
  
<summary>Summary (For Non-Programmers)</summary>

I tested four variations of a system that generates data over time. Some used Unity‚Äôs built-in memory tools, others used my custom arena system. I tracked speed, memory usage, and how often Unity had to ‚Äúclean up‚Äù memory (garbage collection ‚Äî GC).

The results: my arena system reduced memory usage significantly (up to 60%), ran a little faster, and avoided performance stutters caused by uncontrollable memory cleanup; resulting in a smoother experience for processes that are usually prone to freezes/spikes.
</details>

<summary>Technical Explanation (For Programmers)</summary>

Each memory strategy was tested under identical conditions:
- Total allocations: 500 (one per cycle, sustained)
- Buffers: `float[]` (managed) or `ArenaArray<float>` (arena)
- Burst: Enabled or disabled via toggle
- GC tracking: `GC.GetTotalMemory()` and `GC.CollectionCount()`
- Timing: Frame-by-frame measurements using Time.realtimeSinceStartup
- Reset behavior: Arena memory was explicitly `Reset()` after each cycle; managed memory was left to accumulate (as it would in a standard Unity framework).
- Environment: Unity Editor, with custom logging enabled for ArenaAllocator (note that this introduces some artificial overhead).

This simulation represents:
- Consistent short-lived allocation churn
- Heavy per-frame compute on large buffers
- Controlled memory lifecycle for comparison
</details>

I then ran the experiment 10 more times to check for deviation. Below are the results:

## Benchmark Experiment - Results

### First Test Run (control group)

The experiment resulted in 2,000 rows of CSV data. These results were aggregated and visualized to evaluate both **performance speed** and **memory pressure** over time:

<div align="center">
  
| Strategy                       | Avg Time (ms)   | Avg Memory (MB)    | GC Collections  |
|:------------------------------:|:---------------:|:------------------:|:---------------:|
| Managed Memory + Burst         | ~4.27ms         | ~1,689 MB          | 55              |
| Managed Memory + No Burst      | ~55.92ms        | ~1,682 MB          | 58              |
| Arena Memory + No Burst        | ~59.31ms        | ~673 MB            | 2               |
| Arena Memory + Burst           | ~1.25ms         | ~675 MB            | 0               |

</div>

### Key Takeaways
- **Burst** is by far the biggest speed booster, but **Arena** reduces memory footprint dramatically.
- **Arena + No Burst** performs nearly on-par with **Managed + No Burst** in raw speed, but with less than half of the memory usage, and a near-complete elimination of GC calls.
- **Arena + Burst** offers the best of both worlds: the lowest memory footprint and fastest execution.

And because visual data is fun, here are some charts and graphs that bring the data to life:

<p align="center"><em> ^ Note the flat green line. while the other methods are either slow, unpredictable, or both, <b>Arena + Burst</b> remains fast and steady throughout. No GC = no spikes, more determinism.</em></p>

![MemoryUsagePerCycleChart](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ea1fc947-4372-46ca-a12a-afc270ef2c11)
<p align="center"><em>^ Note: while the theoretical peak allocation is ~2GB for 500 x 4MB 1024x1024 buffers, actual memory use under managed memory exceeded 2.7GB due to GC fragmentation, large object heap behavior, and editor overhead. This reflects typical worst-case bloat/pressure when relying on the managed allocator.</em></p>

### Additional 10 Test Runs

These tests resulted in a combined 20,000 rows of CSV data, which were aggregated and visualized with the same metrics as the control group:

<div align="center">
  
| Strategy                       | Avg Time (ms) Per Run   | Avg Memory (MB) Per Run   | Avg GC Collections Per Run             |
|:------------------------------:|:-----------------------:|:-------------------------:|:--------------------------------------:|
| Managed Memory + Burst         | ~3.84ms                 | ~1,651 MB                 | 48                                     |
| Managed Memory + No Burst      | ~54.25ms                | ~1,648 MB                 | 55                                     |
| Arena Memory + No Burst        | ~59.75ms                | ~629 MB                   | 0.1 (1 GC call across all runs)        |
| Arena Memory + Burst           | ~1.27ms                 | ~630 MB                   | 0.3 (3 GC calls across all runs)       |

</div>

### Key Takeaways
- Performance metrics remained consistent with the control group, with minor deviation assumed to be from random editor overhead oddities, incidental editor GC, etc.
- **Arena + Burst** remains by far the most performant system, with minor speed increases over **Managed Memory + Burst** and still ~2.6x less memory footprint.
- **Burst** is still the heavy-lifter for raw speed gains.
- **Arena** near-completely eliminates GC calls, resulting in steady and predictable overhead.
- **Arena *without* Burst** introduces minor speed overhead compared to **Managed *without* Burst**. This suggests that **Arena + Burst** is the optimal workflow, but you can still yield significant memory gains with minimal ms impact without **Burst**.

<p align="center"><em>That near-flat Arena + Burst line amidst the sea of volatility that is Managed + Burst is <b>so</b> satisfying.</em></p>

The raw CSV files for these tests can be found in Assets/Logs if you want to check them for yourself.

**Important Caveat**: As mentioned, these benchmarks were run in-editor with logging enabled for the ArenaAllocator (~600 log entries per test run of the Arena strategy). Real-world performance in builds and/or with logging disabled may be even faster, especially for Arena memory. Anecdotally, my Arena + Burst runs in a build environment with no logging consistently averaged about 0.8ms and 0 GC calls.

## When Should You Use ArenaAllocator?

Use it when you need **tight control over memory** or want to **avoid GC stutters** ‚Äî especially in systems that allocate frequently or work with large buffers.

Ideal use cases include:

### Procedural Generation
- Terrain heightmaps, noise layers, structure gen \
**Why**: You can pre-allocate, write in-place, and reset every frame

### Real-Time Simulation Buffers
- Particles, fluids, heatmaps, cellular automata \
**Why**: Thousands of updates per frame with no GC

### AI & Pathfinding
- NavMesh fields, A* sets, LOS caches, utility maps \
**Why**: Short-lived buffers that burst jobs can tear through

### Custom Physics / Collision Grids
- BVH trees, spatial grids, contact caches \
**Why**: Reset on every tick for deterministic behavior

### Massive Game State / ECS Buffers
- Turn systems, card game branches, dense game logic \
**Why**: Emulates ECS-style temporary buffers

### Image Processing / Volume Data
- Edge detection, compute frame analysis, 3D terrain edits \
**Why**: Avoids GC in high-volume 2D/3D byte or float arrays

### Editor Tooling / Import Pipelines
- Asset importers, mesh post-processing, one-time builders \
**Why**: Avoids churn during editor operations

## Current Features

- **ArenaAllocator** with manual or smart allocation
  - Manual: allows custom alignment setting & size calculation
  - Smart: automatically sets alignment to the next power of 2 greater than or equal to the size of the allocation (minimizes waste)
- **ArenaArray<T>** and **ArenaList<T>** containers
  - ArenaArray<T>: A Burst-compatible, fixed-length array backed by arena-allocated unmanaged memory. Like `NativeArray<T>`, but without ownership or disposal ‚Äî memory is released when the parent `ArenaAllocator` is disposed or reset.
  - ArenaList<T>: A Burst-compatible, unmanaged container that hooks into an arena allocator for high-performance collections. Like `ArenaArray<T>`, this structure does not own its memory and is managed by `ArenaAllocator`'s disposal or reset. Use this in place of `NativeList<T>` if you want integration with memory arenas and automatic disposal, and are okay with      fixed capacities. (ArenaLists can be manually resized via reallocation, but do not grow dynamically like standard Lists.)
- Custom logging with color coding, source labeling, timestamps, and export
- Togglable monitoring system with per-arena allocation tracking (offsets, sizes, tags, over-alignment)
- Multiple arena support with ID-based isolation
- Over-alignment tracking to monitor memory waste
- Fully compatible with Burst and `IJobParallelFor`
- No GC, optional disposal ‚Äî reset the arena, not the heap
- Fully integrated with Unity's Test Framework, including a premade unit test suite with pass/fail reporting
- Extensive guardrails against memory leaks, invalid alignment, OOM errors, segfaults, etc.

## Things I May Add in the Future

- Editor windows for allocation & performance visualization, maybe a CSV importer that plots data to graphs automatically
- Arena wizards & packaging for real-world use
- ArenaHashmap container

## How To Use

This project is currently a research-focused case study, not a production-ready library. That said, if you ***really*** want to plug this into your project, here is an ***extremely barebones*** collection of code that you may find useful for getting started.

`var arena = new ArenaAllocator(id: 0, capacityInBytes: 1024 * 1024, Allocator.Persistent);` -- arena has methods like Allocate, SmartAllocate, Reset, and Dispose.

`var array = new ArenaArray<float>(arena, length: 256, "ExampleBuffer");` -- ArenaArray hooks into an arena for allocation in its constructor, so you don't have to worry about its lifetime management.

I also highly recommend taking a look at both [NoiseGenerator_Unmanaged](https://github.com/zachoriel/We-Have-C-At-Home/blob/main/Assets/Scripts/Memory%20Arena/DemoUsage/NoiseGenerator_Unmanaged.cs) and [ArenaAllocatorTests](https://github.com/zachoriel/We-Have-C-At-Home/blob/main/Assets/Tests/PlayMode/ArenaAllocatorTests.cs) to see real examples ArenaAllocator in action.

You know what's funny? I learned more about memory management by working on this project than I ever did in any of the C++ courses I took in college. I guess making it work in an environment where you're *not supposed* to do it forces you to think about the concepts in a different way.
